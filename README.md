cjs-loader transitively includes commonJS modules for use on the web, and is useful for developers wanting to migrate to ES6 modules who still have legacy dependencies.
[Go here for a demo](https://samthor.github.io/cjs-loader/demo/index.html).

We do this using just your browser, without a compile step, by implementing `require()` and other methods just while loading the module code.
For users of cjs-loader, we provide `load(moduleName)` that returns a `Promise` of the exports.

üî•üë®‚Äçüíªüî• This is an interesting, successful but terrible idea and should not be used by anyone.
It reqiures support for ES6 Modules üõ†Ô∏è and has only really been tested on Chrome 61+.

# Usage

First, install any public modules you want to use with NPM or Yarn.
Then, use the loader:

```html
<script type="module">
import {load, setup} from './path/to/cjs-loader.js';
setup('./path/to/cjs-loader.js');

load('npm-package-name').then((out) => {
  // do whatever as if you require()'d the package
});
</script>
```

For example, to use Handlebars ([as per the demo](https://samthor.github.io/cjs-loader/demo/index.html)):

```js
load('handlebars').then((handlebars) => {
  const Handlebars = handlebars.create();

  const source = '<p>Hello {{name}}, you have {{name.length}} letters</p>';
  const template = Handlebars.compile(source);
  console.info(template({name: 'Sam'}));
});
```

Handlebars internally fetches about ~35 modules (via `require()`), which we wrap.

# Implementation

1. Stub out `module.exports`, `require()` etc.
2. Load the target module as an ES6 module^1
  * If a further dependency is unavailable in `require()`, throw a known exception^2
  * Catch in a global handler, and load the dependency via step 2
  * Retry running the target module when done

^1 more or less

^2 `require()` is synchronous, so we can't block to load more code

## Specific Hacks

[We abuse](https://gist.github.com/samthor/8c5ebf3239bfeaca6c92299bb12b2a79) the fact that Chrome reruns but does _not_ need to reload script files with the same path, but a different hash.
This allows for "efficient" retries.
e.g.:

```js
import * as foo1 from './foo.js#1';
import * as foo2 from './foo.js#2';
foo1 !== foo2  // not the same, but only caused one network request
```

*TODO: document more hacks*

# Notes

Things that we can't fix:

* Don't use this in production.
  It's horrible.

* Modules can't _really_ determine their path, so if one of your dependenies is from a 302 etc, all bets are off

* Runtime `require()` (i.e., not run on initial import) calls will fail if the code isn't available

## TODOs

Things that we can fix:

* Built-in Node packages don't work (`fs`, `path` etc)

* We should coalesce multiple failures to `require()` (just return `null` until an actual error occurs) and request further code in parallel

* This code is forked from [cjs-faker](https://github.com/samthor/cjs-faker), and still supports AMD, but calling an unplanned `require()` from within `define()` doesn't work yet
